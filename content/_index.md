a collection of technical notes.

atm trying to find & test options to add content with the least amount
of effort to add & maintain:
* a basic formatter to offload html and image generation
* a way to handle simple metadata like links & layout.

if you are seeing this you stumbled upon me testing hugo, after having
figured out that the live version of the content includes way to much
js for static content.
