### stuff used

built with [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) using the [hugo-book](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-book/) theme, find them here:

* hugo
  * site: https://gohugo.io/
  * github: https://github.com/gohugoio
* hugo-book theme
  * site: https://hugo-book-demo.netlify.app/
  * github: https://github.com/alex-shpak/hugo-book
  * on hugo themes: https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-book/

### failing forward

if anything, my time will be invested in poking hardware bits hoping they will do what i want, typing & correcting
strings so [perl](https://www.perl.com/) doesn't get mad and having heated discussion when someone is wrong...
on the internet!

will show xkcd comic when i care to find out how to embed it: https://xkcd.com/386

### what mistake?

full content and changelog is available on github, published site is built on push and not stored in an rcs. issue
tracker can be found there as well, it can be used if you need to contact me for whatever reason. issue tracker and
git history will not be set private by me.
