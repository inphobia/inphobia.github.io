built with [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) using the [hugo-book](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-book/) theme, find them here:

* hugo
  * site: https://gohugo.io/

if anything, my time will be invested in poking hardware bits hoping they will do what i want, typing & correcting
strings so [perl](https://www.perl.com/) doesn't get mad and having heated discussion when someone is wrong on
the internet.

will show xkcd coming when i care to find out how to embed it: https://xkcd.com/386



full content and changelog is available on github, published site is built on push and not stored in an rcs.
