# cheatcode
just want the goodies and go? here you go.  
not going the copy the content here as well. would not say no if someone wrote a hugo
template or short code that get's them rendered inline here.

## adapter recommendation
easy choice: [and important choice](hbastart#some-controllers-i-have-used)

## sata doesn't work
decent chance it's due to {{< elink "oops#no-sata-15gbps-support-optical-drives" "one" >}} of {{< elink "oops#no-sata-3gbps-support" "these" >}}.  
an older hba might help, an {{< elink "82885t" "adaptec sas expander" >}} is likely a more interesting choice.


## reformat sas drive to 512b/4k
never a {{< elink "redist" "bad idea" >}} to rush ahead with zero context.

## t10 dif
not run into this yet, but am curious
