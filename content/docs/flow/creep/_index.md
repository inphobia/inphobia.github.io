sometimes you outgrow your case, sometimes you want to shut down a 10 dvd drive tower when it's not in use. let's see where we can get.

## initial setup
- working config we made in previous flow
- old tower case (antec 1200 or thermaltake armor)
- sas expander ({{< elink "82885t" "adaptec 82885t" >}})
- external sas cable (sff-8644 <-> sff-8644)
- power supply
- {{< elink "paperclip" "paperclip" >}}
