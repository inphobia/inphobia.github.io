# goal

sometimes you outgrow your case, sometimes you want to shut down an 10 dvd drive tower when it's not needed. let's see where we can get.

## initial setup
* working config we made in previous flow
* old tower case (antec 1200 or thermaltake armor)
* sas expander (adaptec 82885t)
* external sas cable (sff-8644 <-> sff-8644)
* power supply
* paperclip
