# goal
why not rerip my entire cd collection? up until 2010 i ripped all my cd's to flac with eac, and those files i still have to this day. they all have id3v2 metadata however, which seems to be a pain to convert. the metadata in general can be all over the place. since i added my whole collection in [discogs](https://www.discogs.com/user/inphobia/collection) i made sure the info there is correct. so now it's just a matter of ripping
