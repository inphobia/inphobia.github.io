# stuff used

built around the [hugo-book](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-book/) theme, which implies using [hugo](https://gohugo.io/), find them here:

- hugo-book theme
  - site: https://hugo-book-demo.netlify.app/
  - github: https://github.com/alex-shpak/hugo-book
  - on hugo themes: https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-book/
- hugo
  - site: https://gohugo.io/
  - github: https://github.com/gohugoio
- elink shortcode for easy linking
  - github: https://github.com/boevski/hugo

## why use x when y is clearly better?

- see: [this](#failing-forward)
- hugo-book: active dev, good examples, not much poking needed, actually does what is says.
- hugo: i'm bad at markdown, i'm worse at many other things. 20 mins from markdown to ugly site: win!
- github & git: i'm already on github for stuff
- github pages: was ... acceptable. point me to a subversion analogue and i'll consider.
- stuff in general such as hardware, os, software
  - fits my needs
  - what i have available
  - more can be added if you send hardware & cover my commission cost
    - that's a joke. see issue tracker.

## failing forward

if anything, i aim to invest my time poking hardware bits hoping they'll do what i want, typing & correcting
strings so [perl](https://www.perl.com/) doesn't get mad, having heated discussion when someone is wrong...
on the internet!

will show xkcd comic when i care to find out how to embed it: https://xkcd.com/386

## what mistake?

- full content and changelog is available on github, published site is built on push and not stored in an rcs.
- issue tracker can be found there as well, it can be used if you need to contact me for whatever reason.
- issue tracker and git history will not be set private, deleted nor pruned by me.
- branches might be pruned it they get out of hand, none are planned
- should things to go real sideways archiving the repo will be a last resort.
