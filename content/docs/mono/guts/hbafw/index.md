## firmware choice
you cannot flash firmware downloaded from broadcom to devices that are not broadcom or lsi labeled. while almost all controllers from vendors like cisco, hp, dell, lenovo, etc... are broadcom cards, they do have a unique subsys id, as such you must use the vendor's firmware.

## z

## no firmware downloads here {anchor=false}
i will not upload controller or disk firmware to this site. if the vendor no longer has firmware for a device on their site i would suggest checking archive.org. if all else fails you can try to contact me - figuring out how is the litmus test.
