# spilover

## adaptec arcconf
should allow for better access to 82885t expanders

## even more tools
`adaptec event monitor` and `lsa: lsi storage authority`
i haven't used those yet, likely won't.

## oem tools
it's common for vendors to provide alternative software and/or firmware, this allows their
users to upgrade to newer hardware without having to learn a different tool. perccli by dell will
for example. or like lenovo with their integrated 82885 & hba upgrade packages.
