# what

storcli is the tool to interact with your broadcom card.

## why
needed for most interaction like:
* updating fw
* checking controller
* checking disks


## where
can be downloaded from [https://www.broadcom.com/][].
make sure your version somewhat matches your firmware. i'm using "storcli sas3.5 p36" with a 9500-16e running uefi p36.

## naming
while broadcom refers to this program as "storcli", the actual binary can also be called storcli64 or storcli2, as you can see in several examples.

## todo: basic commandline switches
