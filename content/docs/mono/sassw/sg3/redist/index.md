raid card modes like jbod or passthrough often say then won't intercept
commands, tried it with the cards i have but i could not get it to work.
some raid cards can be flashed to use a hba firmware and enable passthrough,
but that's a story for another time and place.

## determining the current sector size

### using sg_format.exe
> [!NOTE]

```
sg_format.exe PD3
    NETAPP    X371_S164A960ATE  NA54   peripheral_type: disk [0x0]
      Unit serial number: S5JENE0R504188
      LU name: 5002538b0156bb30
Mode Sense (block descriptor) data, prior to changes:
  Number of blocks=1875385008 [0x6fc81ab0]
  Block size=520 [0x208]
Read Capacity (10) results:
   Number of logical blocks=1875385008
   Logical block size=520 bytes
No changes made. To format use '--format'. To resize use '--resize'
```

current blocksize:
> [!NOTE]
> Logical block size=520 bytes

### using smartmontools

for usage of smartmontools see {{< elink "smartmon#show-all-statistics-smartmon-understands" "here" >}}

you'll need to use either `smartctl.exe -a` or `smartctl.exe -x` to
enable this output.

you're looking for the lines starting with:
- `Logical block size:`
  - size presented to the operating system
- `Physical block size:`
  - native size the disk uses

if the logical and physical sizes match only physical will be shown.

- 512byte logical, 4k physical:
  - ```
    Logical block size:   512 bytes
    Physical block size:  4096 bytes
    ```
- 4k logical, 4k physical:
  - ```
    Physical block size:  4096 bytes
    ```
- 520byte logical, 4160byte physical:
  - ```
    Logical block size:   520 bytes
    Physical block size:  4160 bytes
    ```

4160byte is seldom mentioned but straightforward:
just like 4k native drives can use 512byte, the
same goes for 520byte: here to native size equivalent is 4160byte.

you can [reformat to this](#back-to-520-or-4160) as well, which is mostly useless in the context here.

### using storcli

storcli {{< elink "storcli#hangs-and-aborts-to-quick" "hangs easily" >}}, this includes when 520byte disks are attached. i recommond the 2 previous options.

calling {{< elink "storcli" "storcli" >}} what he argument `/c0 show` will have the
sector size under the heading SeSz.

```

```

## reformatting to a different blocksize
we have the option to reformat to 512byte or 4k. you can either check
the datasheet of the drive or trust what
[smartmontools](#using-smartmontools)
says.

- 4k (preferred)
  - the modern standard
  - you can theorycraft how this is faster, in reality this you won't notice even in benchmarks
- 512byte (fallback)
  - when your controller or expander does not support 4k
  - for legacy boot options

### changing to 4k
this uses switch `--size=4096`

```
>sg_format.exe  --format --size=4096 PD3
    NETAPP    X371_S164A960ATE  NA54   peripheral_type: disk [0x0]

### changing to 512 byte
this uses switch `--size=512`

```
>sg_format.exe  --format --size=512 PD6

### back to 520 or 4160
dumb idea unless you have a very specific reason. windows will not be able to write data t
these disks.

you can use `--size=520` and `--size=4160` should you need have a need to. i haven't tested
if the system the drive originally came will accept them again. i'd say chances are slim.
